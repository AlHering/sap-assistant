# Abstract
Data Engineering is a difficult but very important part throughout modern companies. To transform data into information and gain value from the information, Data Engineering is central. However, keeping up with rapidly developing theory, technologies and tools is no simple task. Additionally company data is often clustered throughout different sections, held on different digital or even analog infrastructure and handled with different tools. 
An especially difficult but widely used infrastructure are SAP R/3 systems.
As somewhat of a feasibility study, this project is meant explore options to assist in tasks, connected to the SAP R/3 system. If it is possible to assist with these tasks, working with many other tech stacks and systems around data mangement can be assisted too, following the same basic achitecture.
